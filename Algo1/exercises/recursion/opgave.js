/*
  isOdd

  Parameters
  n: positive integer

  Result
  True if n is odd (= not divisible by 2), false if even.

  Hint
  If n is odd, then so is n+2
*/




/*
  factorial

  Parameters
  n: positive integer

  Result
  1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n
*/






/*
  sum

  Parameters
  xs: array of numbers

  Result
  Sum of all numbers
*/




/*
  product

  Parameters
  xs: array of numbers

  Result
  Product of all numbers
*/




/*
  countZeros

  Parameters
  xs: array of numbers

  Result
  Number of zeros in xs
*/





/*
  removeZeros

  Parameters
  xs: array of numbers

  Result
  Copy of xs with zeros removed
*/




/*
  firstIndexOf

  Parameters
  x: some value
  xs: an array

  Result
  The lowest i such that xs[i] === x, or -1 if x does not appear in xs
*/




/*
  removeAt

  Parameters
  xs: an array
  idx: a positive integer

  Result
  A copy of xs where the item with index idx has been removed
*/




/*
  isSubsetOf

  Parameters
  xs: an array
  ys: an array

  Result
  True is all alements xs appear in ys (in any order).
  ys is allowed to have more items.
  Elements in xs need to appear at least as frequently in ys
  in order for xs to be a subset of ys.

/*
  duplicateEachItem

  Parameters
  xs: array

  Result
  A copy of the array xs where each element has been duplicated, e.g. [1,2] -> [1,1,2,2]

/*
  knapsack

  Parameters
  n: a positive integer
  ns: an array of positive integers

  Result
  Find a subarray of ns such that its sum is equal to n.
  If no solution can be found, return null.

  Example
  n=10, ns=[2,4,6,9]  ===>  [4,6] because 4+6 == 10
